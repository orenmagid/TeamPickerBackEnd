# Team Splitter

This is the repository for the backend of a project <a href="https://github.com/awchang12">Anthony Chang</a> and I worked on for the React module of the Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering Bootcamp.

The frontend repository is available <a href="https://github.com/orenmagid/team_splitter_frontend">here</a>.

Team Splitter is an app designed to help groups of pickup basketball players choose teams fairly, and have fun in the process. Basically, if you play basketball with a group regularly, you'd all create accounts and rate each other, and these ratings would be used to divide players into teams. You'd rate each other by comparing each other to NBA basketball players.

Let's say your group's name is "Bucket Patrol" and John is a regular. When you rate John, you'll be asked, "In the context of Bucket Patrol, which player is John most similar to?" and presented with the following:

## Demo

You can check it out at https://team-splitter.herokuapp.com/. Because Heroku's <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours">free dyno hours</a> <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping">go to sleep</a> if the app hasn't been used in thirty minutes, the app may be unresponsive for about 30 secs when you first attempt to use it. Unfortunately, this applies to the frontend and the backend. So, it may be about thirty seconds before the webpage loads, and then another delay before the database is responsive.
